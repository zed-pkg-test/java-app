# Futures, await, blocking I/O, and scheduler suspension

Status: runtime Future/suspension ABI implemented on top of the OresVM four-domain
scheduler. Source-frame lowering for arbitrary nested `await` expressions is a
compiler follow-up and must target this ABI; the recursive evaluator fails closed
inside actor turns rather than blocking or inline-resuming a carrier.

## Rule: ordinary execution does not implicitly yield

Yielding is a property of specific suspension operations and scheduler policy,
not of every Oreslang call.

| Operation | Scheduler yield? |
| --- | --- |
| ordinary `fnc` / `routine` call | no |
| CPU work | no |
| start nonblocking I/O and keep its Future | no |
| `await future` | yes, always |
| Ores blocking/suspending I/O | yes while waiting |
| empty inbox receive | yes |
| timer/sleep wait | yes |
| scheduler safepoint | normally no |
| untrusted fuel/deadline exhaustion at a safepoint | forced handoff/abort |

A nonblocking call therefore behaves like:

```ores
val pending = socket.read_async(buffer);

// Still the same execution turn.
calculate_something();

val bytes = await pending;
// await ends the turn and resumes from a continuation later.
```

Calling an async operation is not itself a scheduling boundary.

## OresFuture is not CompletableFuture

`Future<T>` is represented by the runtime-owned `OresFuture<T>`.

It deliberately does **not** implement Java `CompletionStage` and does not
inherit `thenApply`, `thenAccept`, `thenRun`, or other APIs whose callback
may execute according to a producer's completion policy.

The runtime owns completion. Guest code may:

- observe done/cancelled state;
- request cancellation;
- await the Future.

Runtime components may register an internal completion waiter. Such a waiter may
only settle another runtime Future, release runtime accounting, or enqueue a
continuation. It must not execute Oreslang guest code.

Host `CompletionStage` values are compatibility inputs only. They are
immediately normalized into an OresFuture before they participate in Oreslang
suspension.

## Await

The semantic lowering is:

```text
evaluate awaited operation
        |
        v
OresFuture<T>
        |
        v
capture resume point + live locals
        |
        v
register enqueue-only waiter
        |
        v
release logical execution lease / carrier
        |
        v
WAITING
        |
        | Future settles
        v
enqueue owning continuation
        |
        v
correct OresVM scheduler domain
        |
        v
reacquire logical execution lease
        |
        v
restore frame and continue after await
```

`await` is a scheduling boundary even when the Future was already settled.
The continuation is enqueued for a later turn instead of being resumed inline.

For actors, the current runtime target is
`ActorContext.suspendOn(OresFuture, ActorContinuation)`. The existing host
`CompletionStage` overload is only an adapter and normalizes to OresFuture.

A suspended actor remains logically inside the same mailbox turn:

- later inbox messages cannot overtake it;
- the admitted message graph remains rooted/accounted while captured by the
  continuation;
- completion threads never acquire actor execution authority;
- resumption may occur on a different carrier;
- the actor's generation lease remains valid across suspension.

## Safepoint is not suspension

A compiler/runtime safepoint checks control state such as cancellation, deadline,
fuel, debugger/maintenance requests, and untrusted execution policy.

A normal safepoint does **not** yield merely because it was reached.

For untrusted actors, a safepoint can become an enforced handoff/termination
point when fuel, deadline, or other sandbox policy requires it. This is separate
from cooperative `await`.

## Blocking-looking I/O

An Ores API may expose synchronous-looking behavior while using logical
suspension internally:

```ores
val bytes = fd.read(buffer);
```

If `read` is a suspending/blocking effect, the language semantics are:

```text
start/dispatch host operation
capture continuation
suspend logical Ores task
return carrier to OresVM
resume when operation completes
```

It must never mean "park this Ores actor carrier in a host blocking call."

Native async readiness should be preferred for sockets, pipes, timers, and other
reactor-friendly operations.

## VM-owned blocking bridge

When a host API is genuinely blocking, OresVM owns two implementation paths.

### Java blocking calls

Trusted Java blocking interop uses bounded admission plus Java virtual threads.

Virtual threads are an implementation substrate only:

- Actor != Java virtual thread.
- OresVM remains the scheduling authority.
- Java virtual threads do not receive ActorCell, OresVM, OresContext, or guest
  mutable actor state.
- completion settles an OresFuture; it never resumes guest code directly.

### JNI / FFM / native or unknown blocking calls

Native calls can pin or ignore virtual-thread unmounting, so they use a bounded
platform-thread executor.

The native queue uses abort-on-saturation. It never uses CallerRunsPolicy.
Therefore saturation cannot make an actor carrier execute the blocking call.

Cancellation is a request, not proof that host work stopped. Admission for a
running uncooperative Java blocking call remains charged until its worker
actually exits.

## Four scheduler domains

Continuation wakeup preserves the task's owning domain:

```text
OresVM
├── CONTROL
│   ├── supervisor/root work
│   └── ActorGroup mailmen
├── SHARED_ACTOR
├── ISOACTOR
└── UNTRUSTED_ACTOR
```

I/O reactors, timer drivers, completion threads, Java virtual threads used for
blocking interop, and native blocking workers are runtime service threads. They
are not additional Ores scheduler domains and may not execute actor guest code.

## Compiler effect model

The intended compiler effect categories are:

```text
NOSUSPEND
MAY_SUSPEND
BLOCKING_HOST
```

Pure code is a refinement of NOSUSPEND rather than a scheduling category.

`await` is an explicit MAY_SUSPEND boundary. A synchronous-looking I/O
primitive may be MAY_SUSPEND because its implementation dispatches host work and
suspends the logical task. BLOCKING_HOST identifies the low-level interop
operation that must be moved to the VM blocking bridge.

The compiler must reject ordinary borrows/guards that would escape across a
suspension unless their ownership/lifetime representation explicitly permits it.

## Current lowering boundary

The actor scheduler, OresFuture, timer path, and blocking bridge provide the
runtime substrate. The recursive reference evaluator cannot safely preserve an
arbitrary Java call stack across an actor `await`.

Until the stackless/CPS source-frame transformation lands, source `await`
encountered inside an actor turn fails closed instead of:

- blocking the carrier;
- using `join()`;
- inline-resuming an already-completed Future;
- allowing a producer thread to execute guest code.

The compiler lowerer must produce heap-safe resume frames containing the program
counter and live Oreslang locals and call the existing suspension ABI.
