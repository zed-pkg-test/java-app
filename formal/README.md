# Formal verification layer

This directory documents the executable formal-methods layer for Oreslang runtime semantics.

## What is proved now

`FormalActorProtocolModelCheckTest` is a bounded explicit-state model checker for the actor protocol/Future hand-off lifecycle. It enumerates every legal transition in the small-state model rather than sampling thread schedules.

The checked invariants are:

1. **At-most-once protocol settlement.** A reply is completed or cancelled, never both and never twice.
2. **Mailbox reservation conservation.** A queued request/continuation owns exactly one bounded mailbox reservation; every terminal state owns zero.
3. **No completion-thread guest execution.** Future completion is notification-only. Guest continuation code can run only after mailbox re-entry.
4. **No resurrection after teardown.** Stop/runtime-close transitions cancel outstanding protocol work and late Future completion cannot revive it.
5. **Serialized actor execution.** A protocol request has one initial guest turn and at most one resumed continuation turn.
6. **Weak progress.** Every reachable live non-terminal state has a path to a terminal reply when progress actions are scheduled.

## Relationship to runtime tests

This model is deliberately smaller than `ActorRuntime`. Its purpose is to make the semantic contract reviewable and exhaustive. Integration tests must separately prove that concrete runtime traces refine these transitions.

The companion `async-testing` proof repo contains runtime refinement checks over real channels/select/actors. A runtime change is not considered fully verified merely because the model is green: both the model and implementation-level proofs should pass.

## Running

```sh
mvn -B -Dtest=FormalActorProtocolModelCheckTest test
```

No additional model-checking dependency is required; the finite-state explorer is implemented with ordinary Java/JUnit so it runs anywhere the existing compiler/runtime test suite runs.

## Next formal targets

The next models should cover:

- Channel/select registration, exactly-one arbitration, cancellation, and waiter detachment.
- ActorGroup Mailman sequencing and CONTROL-carrier fairness.
- Allocation-domain provenance and `rt copy/share/take/borrow/proxy` authority transitions.
- GC lifecycle: actor/process roots, ReferenceQueue retry, context shutdown, and domain-local collection.
- Spawn tree supervision and failure propagation.

For unbounded properties we should add a second tier using an external prover/model checker once its toolchain is pinned reproducibly; this bounded executable layer remains useful as the fast CI gate.
